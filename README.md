# Heart Disease Prediction
This machine learning project is used to predict heart disease.

## Tools Used
Tools like scikit, matlabplot, numpy, and pandas have been used for the implementation of this project.

## Model
This project uses several machine learning classification algorithms that includes RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, LinearSVC, SVC, and KNeighborsClassifier.\
The best result is obtained with LogisticRegression and so is used for further experimentation.

## Usage
You can get a better idea of implementing several machine learning tools like pandas, numpy, scikit, and matplotlib.
